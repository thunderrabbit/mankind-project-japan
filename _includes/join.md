MKP Open Men's Groups are designed as an entry level group to provide a place for men to experience sharing deeply, personally, of themselves. We are a peer support group. We expect men to work with local community professionals for therapeutic support.

This group is not a good fit for men who are actively engaged in domestic violence, alcoholism, recreational drug use, or experiencing suicidal ideation.
