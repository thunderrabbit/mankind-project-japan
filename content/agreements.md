## Mission and Purpose
The purpose of the ManKind Project is to create a safer world by growing “better” men. We do this by training men and supporting them in groups. The MKP Japan mission is to create a world where men act on their individual and shared responsibility for the future of humanity by initiating and supporting men on a path of emotional maturity, spiritual awareness, and deepening community.

## Our Vision
Our vision is a safe world where all men are brothers, in relationship with one another … a world where conflicts are resolved peacefully; where torture, genocide, domestic violence, and senseless war are only entries in the history books …where men are fully accountable and take responsibility for their decisions …where men stand tall and proud to be men, secure in their role and deeply committed to nurturing one another, their families, their communities, and their planet.

## Our Core Values
Accountability * Authenticity * Compassion * Generosity * Integrity * Intercultural Competency * Leadership * Respect

## Agreements

### Confidentiality

What I say and do here is confidential. I will only share my own experience and personal insights. I will not share another man's words, actions, or identity outside this group. If I wish to mention anything specific a man shared in a previous meeting, I will ask his permission first.

Confidentiality is there to create a sense of safety for all. Confidentiality does not apply in situations of abuse or neglect of children and the elderly and/or threat to harm self or others. If someone's life is in immediate danger, action may be required.

### No recording

No one is to record this meeting in any way.

### Punctuality

I will arrive on time. If I arrive late, I may not be allowed into that day's meeting.

### Ethical Relationships

No solicitations. This is not a business group, dating group or a place to push religious beliefs or political agendas. I will refrain from initiating any personal relationship with other participants that a reasonable person would find unethical or exploitative.

### Non-Violence

I will refrain from violence, whether physical, verbal, emotional, or spiritual. I take responsibility for my words and actions and acknowledge that they impact those around me.

### No Drugs or Alcohol

No drugs or alcohol. I will not attend the group while under the influence of alcohol or recreational drugs. If I break this agreement, I will tell the group and accept the group's choice in handling this to maintain a safe space for the men present.

### Participation

I will speak openly and truthfully in "I" statements (not "you" or "he" statements).

I will not interrupt verbally - but instead, use hand gestures to signify resonance or ask a question. Exceptions are for facilitation, timekeeping or maintaining safety.

I am responsible for taking care of myself. If I have questions, or need something, I will ask.

### Advice & Feedback

I am not here to fix or help others: I serve myself and the group by taking responsibility for anything that comes up for me personally.

I am not here to give or ask for advice. However, I can share relevant experiences from my own life or invite men to share theirs.

I will ask permission before offering feedback. Feedback reflects what I heard/saw/felt in the man who just shared.

### Safety

Safety is everyone's responsibility. Any man may pass at any time or stop or pause any process to maintain safety.

Checking out
I will check out before hanging up. I understand men could be concerned for my welfare, and I will respond if someone contacts me. If I fail to do so or exhibit concerning behaviour, someone from MKP Japan may contact my emergency contact or emergency services.

### Online Etiquette
- I will keep my video and audio connected throughout the meeting.
- I will join from a private location (no roommates/partners present).
- I will mute myself when I'm not talking.
- I will be fully present and not multitask. (e.g. not browsing the web or checking my phone during the meeting.)
- I will refrain from eating during the meeting.
- If my internet drops, I will contact the organisers using the information provided to me.
- I will always pay attention to the screen in case someone is trying to communicate with me.

### Acknowledgement & Commitment
ManKind Project's training, programs, and groups are not a substitute for professional mental health services. I am a man of 18 years of age or older. Mankind Project Japan only welcomes those who agree to be respectful, compassionate and welcoming to all who attend, regardless of their race/ethnicity, ability, socio-economic status, age, religion, or sexual orientation. I understand that I may be removed from the group for being disruptive or not following these agreements.
