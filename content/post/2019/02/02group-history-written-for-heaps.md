I have not updated this site recently, so thought I would capture this email I wrote in response to a press inquiry:


____, I am excited to hear of your article in Japanese!  Here in Tokyo, we have just begun translating into Japanese one of Mankind Project's introductory workshops.

My name is Rob Nugen. [I joined MKP in 1997 at the age of 27](https://new.robnugen.com/journal/1997/11/15/new-warrior-training/). It was during my initiation weekend that I realized I was a man.  I had moved out of my parent's house 8 years prior, but I still thought of myself as a boy (without realizing it).

I moved to Japan in 2003 and looked for Mankind Project, but there were no other MKP men here (that I could find).   By 2007 or so, some men who had attended trainings outside Japan formed a circle in Tokyo, which I joined for a few years.  We did not actively seek new men and the circle fizzled out by 2010 or so.

After getting married, I realized I needed the support of a men's circle, so I restarted our circle in 2015.  We were 3 MKP men, including [Japanese psychiatrist Takeshi Tamura](https://www.tamuratakeshi.jp/about.php).  In 2015, we began to invite new men into the circle, even if they had not attended the New Warrior Training Adventure.

We meet every Tuesday, in Takeshi's office in Hiroo, Tokyo.  [New men are welcome](https://www.meetup.com/ManKind-Project-Tokyo/) on the first Tuesday of the month, and then any Tuesday thereafter.

The meetings are in English for now, but the translation work I mentioned should be done within a month or two.  I imagine we could present an introductory training in Japanese this year, but we have not yet talked about who could lead a Japanese language circle afterward.

I would be happy to speak with you, and we can likely set up a meeting with some of the other men in Tokyo, including Takeshi, as well as JSL (Japanese as a second language) speakers.

You can reach me here or via Skype, Facebook, Google..  My username is thunderrabbit on all three platforms.

best,
Rob
