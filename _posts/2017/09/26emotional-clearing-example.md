Tonight the co-gender group had its first meeting after our initial 8
meetings.  Two new people came and seemed keen enough that they will
attend again.  I did a process which helped people see the value of
emotional clearing work:

    Feeling:
       anger at my wife because she buys crap she does not need

    Anger source:
	   helpless, feeling sadness that consumerism is polluting earth

    Feel sadness where:
	   actually not in my body, like it's out in front of
       me, like I have lost touch with my groundedness

    How to regain groundedness:
	   go climb a tree, reconnect with nature

So to recap, my anger at my wife is really hiding sadness about my own
disconnect from nature.
